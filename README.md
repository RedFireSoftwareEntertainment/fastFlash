# fastFlash

## What this?

A **lightweight, open-source, completely customizable and free** .iso file flasher written in bash, made for AZOS GNU/Linux by Red Fire Software Entertainment. **Part of the RedKit tool-set!**

## Features

Some features of this software are:

 - **Small and Lightweight**
 - **Simple** to use
 - Nearly **0** errors
 - **Fast** (obviously)

## Installation

 1. Download the latest stable release of the source code from the releases tab.
 2. Open a terminal inside the source code folder or `cd` into it and type: `sudo ./makeff.sh`
 3. Done! ðŸŽ‰
 
 or you could just save yourself all of the trouble by just getting [AZOS GNU/Linux](https://sites.google.com/view/azosofficialsite/download/versions). Version 2.0 has fastFlash and the rest of RedKit built-in :)

## Dependencies

 1. **unzip**
 2. **pacman**

## Usage
Syntax is explained by using `fF -h` but we are going to show it here as well for the sake of documentation:
   



     Syntax:bH [action] ([isofile]) ([drive]) ([bssize])
    
     Actions:
                   -f | flashes a .iso file. Specify your file or the directory and the file
                      | in the place of ([isofile]) and the drive in place of ([drive]). ex. /dev/sdc (where sdc is replaced with your drive name)
                   -l | lists all of your drives, don't specify anything after.
                   -h | shows this, don't specify anything after. 

               
         


## Drawbacks
Unfortunately, it is not perfect... **YET!** ðŸ˜‰

but no really, there are some sad drawbacks to this.

 1. Not many features
 
## Goals
 - [ ] More features.
 - [ ] GUI interface.
